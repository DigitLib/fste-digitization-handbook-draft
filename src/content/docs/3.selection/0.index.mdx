## Introduction/explanation of the step

In order to successfully digitize, publish and share -part of- your collection, it is recommended to treat this as a project: specific targets to be reached within a specific period of time (aim at less than 1 year) and with necessary resources.

In this step you need to decide on what you want to accomplish with your project (the “why”), what part of your collection you want to digitize (the “what”) and plan the necessary steps, taking into account your resources like people and budget (the “how”).

The following text is meant to help you in the planning of your project by providing explanation, guidelines and tools, suited to your needs and freely available. So you don’t have to discover it all by yourself.
