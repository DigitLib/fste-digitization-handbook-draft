title: Digitization Process
---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## The process of digitization can be divided into three main steps:

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="1. Preparation" icon="approve-check">
        Preparation of analog / physical objects for digitization
    </Card>
    <Card title="2. Capturing" icon="add-document">
        Use an appropriate device for capturing.
    </Card>
    <Card title="3. Editing" icon="setting">
        Correcting and preparing for publishing.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

### As a result of a Digitization Process, we got only 3 types of files:

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="1. IMAGE FILES" icon="information">
        tiff, jpg, ...
    </Card>
    <Card title="2. AUDIO FILES" icon="information">
        wave, flac, mp3, ...
    </Card>
    <Card title="3. VIDEO FILES" icon="information">
        mp4, mov, ...
    </Card>
</CardGrid>
