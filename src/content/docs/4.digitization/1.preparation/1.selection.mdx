title: Selection

The first and the most important step in selection is **COPYRIGHT LIMITS**. That means that specific materials have a specific duration of Copyright.

Regarding that states have its own legislation **CHECK HOW IS DEFINED DURATION OF Copyright PROTECTION.** The safest way is to use Public Access material. 

What PUBLIC ACCESS means?

It means that the Copyright limit is legally over and the material is in Public Access. For example, some states have Copyright limit on literary authors exceed after 75 years from authors death. Inform yourself about biography of author you want to digitize.

If the Copyright limit still exists, the safest way is to sign an approval contract with the Copyright holder (author or his family, publisher ...).
