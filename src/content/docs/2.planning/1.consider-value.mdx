title: Consider the value of and need for digitisation
---
   Digitisation is valuable for many purposes, including conservation and preservation, reproduction, research, education, exploration, and creative or tourism-related reuses.

   Digitisation can provide worldwide virtual access to your collection and your museum/organisation,  
   Digitisation can contribute to better protection of physical cultural heritage sites and objects by enabling research or discovery using digitised materials instead of direct handling.

   However, digitisation itself does not prevent risks to cultural heritage, and it is by no means a replacement of physical preservation.
   Furthermore, digitisation by itself does not imply digital preservation in the long term.
