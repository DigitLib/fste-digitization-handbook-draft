title: Decide whether to digitise in-house or outsource
---
   Evaluate your in-house 3D digitisation capabilities. What human resources, skills and equipment are available in-house? What additional resources or training would be necessary?

   Carry out a cost-benefit analysis to consider whether in-house digitisation or outsourcing offers the best value for your project.

   Consider also how easy or difficult it would be to upgrade an in-house 3D work environment, and the availability of support and learning materials for the different 3D digitisation methods.

   Persons who deal with 3D digitisation, including especially when outsourcing, must have the capacity to understand the limits of different 3D techniques as well as to analyse and judge the results.

   When outsourcing, seek technical advice from 3D experts with specific experience in the area of cultural heritage and use 3D digitisation service providers with specific experience in working with cultural heritage or in other similar or relevant areas.
