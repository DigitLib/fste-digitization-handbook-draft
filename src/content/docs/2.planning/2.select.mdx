title: Select what to digitise and for what use cases or user groups
---
Define the rationale or purpose(s) of your 3D digitisation project.

   Focus on cultural heritage that is at risk or has high re-use value in digitised form.

   Consider the target user group(s) for whom you would digitise and how they would use such content.

   Examine the features of what you would digitise.

   Different use cases require different equipment and digitisation strategies, and different minimum quality levels.

   Involve non-digitisation departments, such as communication, education, or conservation, in co-designing and following up the digitisation project.
