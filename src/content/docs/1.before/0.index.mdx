Before you start digitizing a selected part of your collection(s), it’s important that you consider the following:

* What do you want to achieve and who do you want to reach with your digitized collection?
* If you know what you want to digitize, can you estimate quantities, complexity, time needed, staff needed and budget needed?
* Do you have sufficient in-house resources (human and equipment)? Or will you outsource part of the work?
* Do you have sufficient budget available?
* Select the documents/works (see table below); what types of materials will you digitize?
* What type of digitized material will you produce? I.e. 3D-models? 2D-images?
* What standards will you adhere to, both for data and metadata?
* How will you document the whole process?
* Restore what needs to be restored before digitization
* If possible, make a Pilot project, digitize part of the collection and learn from it
* Make the whole thing a “project*
